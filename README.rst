Welcome to Open Dylan!
======================

Open Dylan is a compiler and a set of libraries for the Dylan
programming language.  If you're interested in working on the compiler
and core libraries then you've come to the right place.  If you want
to write your own Dylan libraries and *use* the compiler then you
should `download a binary release <http://opendylan.org/download/>`_
and then read the `Getting Started
<http://opendylan.org/documentation/getting-started/>`_ guide.

Open Dylan has two back-ends, HARP (which translates to native x86
code) and a C back-end.

The HARP back-end uses the Memory Pool System (MPS) from Ravenbrook,
Limited to do its memory management.  The MPS is available from
Ravenbrook at http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/ and must be
downloaded and built separately. If you are using Windows, you
must download the `older 1.108 release
<http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/1.108.0/>`_. On
other platforms, the `1.114 release
<http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/1.114.0/>`_ is
required.

The C back-end uses Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative C/C++ garbage
collector, available at https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc

Open Dylan is written in Dylan, thus a Dylan compiler is needed to
bootstrap it. Binary releases are available from
http://opendylan.org/download/

Once installed, the following commands will build and run a
hello-world binary::

  make-dylan-app hello-world
  cd hello-world
  dylan-compiler -build hello-world
  _build/bin/hello-world

Note: If there is no _build directory already, dylan-compiler will
create it and build all used libraries.  Subsequent builds will be
much faster.


Compilation of the compiler itself
==================================

Clone the git repository::

  git clone git://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan.git --recursive


Compilation on UNIX
===================

Please note that on 64 bit Linux we need a big stack, the default
stack is too small, please increase with ulimit -s before (safe is
to double its value)

Dependencies
------------

Get MPS or boehm-gc, depending on your platform:

* Linux x86 or FreeBSD x86 (HARP) -> `MPS <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/1.114.0/>`_
* Mac OS X and all 64 bit (C) -> boehm-gc

On Mac OS X, you may find it easiest to install Homebrew and install
the following::

    brew install autoconf automake bdw-gc --universal

You will also need to install the command line build tools available from
Apple. If your installation of ``bdw-gc`` is not universal (doesn't contain
both i386 and x86_64 code), you will need to uninstall it and install again
with the ``--universal`` flag.

On Ubuntu, you can install the necessary dependencies with::

    apt-get install autoconf automake gcc libgc-dev

Building
--------

To go on and do the build::

  export PATH=/path/to/opendylan/bin:$PATH
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/opendylan-current
  make
  sudo make install

The build process will attempt to select the correct garbage collector
implementation based on your platform.

If you are on a platform using MPS (``x86-linux`` or ``x86-freebsd``),
you will need to add a flag to ``configure`` to point it at the MPS
sources, using ``--with-mps``::

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/opendylan-current --with-mps=/path/to/mps

See the `Dependencies`_ section above for details on obtaining a copy
of the MPS library.

On other platforms, the Boehm GC will be used. If you have installed the
Boehm GC via your operating system package manager, you may not need to
specify the location of the Boehm GC. It will be found automatically if
it is in ``/usr`` or ``/usr/local``. If you have installed the Boehm GC
into a non-standard location or the configure script can not find it,
you can point it in the right direction by using ``--with-gc``::

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/opendylan-current --with-gc=/path/to/boehm

By default, this will build a fully bootstrapped compiler with the
first generation in ``Bootstrap.1/bin/dylan-compiler``, the second
generation in ``Bootstrap.2/bin/dylan-compiler``, and the third in
``Bootstrap.3/bin/dylan-compiler``. The third generation will then be
installed as ``/opt/opendylan-current/bin/dylan-compiler``.

Make sure that the target installation directory has been deleted. If you try
to install into a directory that already has an older version of Open Dylan in
it, the build will fail.

Running Tests
-------------

We have an extensive set of tests which can be run once a full bootstrap
(the default build, ``3-stage-bootstrap``) is complete::

  make check

This runs the tests for the core language implementation as well as for many
bundled libraries.  However, there are currently many test failures which
need to be fixed. Most of the test failures are minor issues or are due to
unimplemented tests rather than major bugs. Help is welcome in improving
our test suites.

Compilation on Windows
=======================

* Get `MPS <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/1.108.0/>`_. Be
  sure that you have the older 1.108 release and NOT the newer 1.114
  release.

* Make sure to have required tools installed: namely Debugging tools for
  Windows, a C compiler (PellesC or VC6) and Microsoft Platform SDK.

* Open a shell (windows command processor), there set the environment
  variable SDK4MEMORY_POOL_SYSTEM to <where you unpacked MPS>.

* Please keep in mind that paths with whitespaces are not well supported.

* Go to admin\\builds and do a::

  build-release.bat <target-dir> /sources <git-checkout>\sources /internal

This will do a 4-stage bootstrap, in the end there will be a
complete IDE in <target-dir>.

* Building an installer:

* Get NSIS from http://nsis.sf.net and the HTML help workshop (from
  Microsoft, to generate the chm).

* Go to packages\\win32-nsis, read Build.txt and follow the
  instructions. Make sure you are using the same command shell as used
  for building Open Dylan (to retain environment variables).


Building the MPS
================

This is not required anymore since it is part of building the runtime.
